Getting Started
===============

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 1.51 or higher

2. Install [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) 1.51 or higher

3. Not required, but **highly** recommended: install [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt#on-the-stable-toolchain) and configure your editor to run it on save.

Verify that you have the right version of cargo by running:

```shell
cargo --version
```

It should print a version number of 1.51 or higher.

Finally, clone this repository 

You're all set!
